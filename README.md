# BlockEstate 
BlockEstate is an end to end platform that helps raise capital for public projects by increasing creating a marketplace for such investments. There are two key aspects of the project:
a) Algogrand Standard Asset: Enables the creation of the digital asset ledger, deployment of the smart contract and tokenization of the asset.
b) Marketplace: Provides a platform to retail and institutional investors to buy bonds, trade them on a P2P basis, receive dividends in stablecoin. Furthermore, investors can use the dashboard feature to monitor and manage their bond portfolios.
